# Features

Quick Field adds convenient functionality to the Craft CMS field layout designer, that you'd normally need to go to the control panel's Fields page to do.

## Creating, editing and deleting fields

Quick Field lets you create new fields, using the New Field button above the search bar in the field layout sidebar. This makes a modal window appear, where you can fill out your new field's settings.

You can also edit existing fields in the sidebar, by clicking the edit button on the field. The modal window that appears will also give you the option to delete the field.

Editing fields on the field layout is currently not supported, but this will be added in a future release.

## Creating, renaming and deleting field groups

Quick Field also gives you a New Group button, which will prompt you for the name of your new field group.

Field groups that are empty in the sidebar - whether due to having no fields, or all of their fields being used in the field layout - will stay visible in the sidebar, so they can still be renamed or deleted via the menu button next to the group name.

Deleting a field group will also delete any fields belonging to it, including any fields being used in the field layout.
